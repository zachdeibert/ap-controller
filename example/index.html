        <p>
            This is an example of a controller that you can make using the
            <span class="pre">ap-controller</span> framework.
            If you click on this page, it will change the color of the LED if
            you have attached it to the GPIO of the Pi between the ground and
            GPIO 21 (the two pins closest to the USB/Ethernet ports).
            When you are connecting the LED,
            <span class="bold">do not forget</span> to add a resistory in the
            circuit.
            If it doesn't work, try switching the two pins on the LED (they are
            polarized).
